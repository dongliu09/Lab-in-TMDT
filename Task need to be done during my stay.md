# Tasks to seek for the MD degree in otolarynology

What i've decided now for the graduation date is to postdate to next March. I have to reorganize myself to get the application for the master in Norway, which is thought be silly literally but to be honest, i need to choose to live in a different city if i'm planning to change myself.

最近重新看的东野圭吾的嫌疑人X的献身一书中，给了我很多的启示和感悟。If you are going to force yourself to be adapted to something, exampled by the society. You have to choose a career, right? In this way you need to find what you have fallen in love with and borden your horizen as possible.



BTW, music and tea are truly my favorist all the time. Includng THE COFFEE. 



New aims facing the issues. Now I have two choices in front of me. Post-docs or masters in biomedicine.

Since Post-docs is the easier and more smooth way to go, held by the majority of people, however, the prospectives of the position is not quite satisfying. I'm not holding the PhD degree in aborad so im not quite competitive in the joh seeking period. And morever, I have not continued the sysmatic and logical training in science and in biomedical science. I've not qulified to be a research scientist in not only academic institutes and in industrial companies.

In such a case, I perfered to choose as a new, fresh biomedical or so-called biotechnology students in Norway, which i hope to be there. A wonderful place to study and to live peacefully, harmonously. After qulified to graduate as a biomedical Msc, hopefully i could be offerd the precious opportunity to enter the PhD program or I could find a place for my intership/

In my opinion, I think I shoud try them both (PhD and intership). It's not a fault or mistake to not holding a dreamful position, since we are young, there's essential for us to try the roads to be sucessful, not the road others thought you should go. Am I right?
