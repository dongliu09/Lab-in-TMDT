# Lab meeting and summery for my visiting study
This is the demo version for presentation in the lab meetings to introduce the projects i'm currently working on.
So the project Iâ€™m working on is nanoparticle in the treatment of cancer. The aim in our lab is to establish the animal model in different stage to be treated via nanoparticle loaded with drug or contrast agent.

So about the **experience** during the visiting period in Toronto, I've achieve some results even thoug h it still need to be modifed and polished for publication. I've learnt a lot about the biotechnology and nanomedicine based cancer thearpy, which is totally a novel propespective for me. The combination subjects and topic dragging the chemical science and bioscience and using novel and cutting egdg method which most likely to be appled in clinical medine. I' ve learnt the basic chemical research and get a bit glance at the dozens of imaging technology.

## Before leaving (main task)

1. summery my data of the projects i'm currently working on.
2. to get more in vitro data. 



## Anything can happen

1. The ICP-MS machine was down yesterday. I did not know if that's my mistake or not? But there's no sign anyone else used in Tuesday. 
2. I am gathering the data but felt a litter tired these days. 



## The farawell lunch and gift from the lab

After Tue's labmeeting, there's a traditional farewell lunch for the leaving member and we choose to eat sushi this time. Though i haven't say a lot in the lunch. I was warmhearted by the kindness of the group and their surprising gifts. Thank you all for adding the fanstastic memory in my last week in Zheng lab.



## About the task and work going

Zheng lab provided the excelent conditons for researches and permit the students to illustrate their ideas and In my mind, this is what a promising group should have. First you have the motivation to go deeper into your area, and you have the abandunt funding to support it, which need your talents in the "a-ha" moment in your research area. Not just repeat or mimic the proved theroy, but lead out the new sight into into from the constrution to application in treatment. God bless the group. 



I'll leave next Monday so MISS YOU ALL!
