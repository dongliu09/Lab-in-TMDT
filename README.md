# Lab meeting and summery for my visiting study
This is the demo version for presentation in the lab meetings to introduce the projects i'm currently working on.
So the project Iâ€™m working on is nanoparticle in the treatment of cancer. The aim in our lab is to establish the animal model in different stage to be treated via nanoparticle loaded with drug or contrast agent.

So about the **experience** during the visiting period in Toronto, I've achieve some results even thoug h it still need to be modifed and polished for publication. I've learnt a lot about the biotechnology and nanomedicine based cancer thearpy, which is totally a novel propespective for me. The combination subjects and topic dragging the chemical science and bioscience and using novel and cutting egdg method which most likely to be appled in clinical medine. I' ve learnt the basic chemical research and get a bit glance at the dozens of imaging technology.
